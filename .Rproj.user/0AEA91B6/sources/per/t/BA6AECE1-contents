# 1. Importing important price data
Every time I go to the supermarket, my wallet weeps a little. But how expensive is food around the world? In this notebook, we'll explore time series of food prices in Rwanda from the [United Nations Humanitarian Data Exchange Global Food Price Database](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices). Agriculture makes up over 30% of Rwanda's economy, and over 60% of its export earnings (CIA World Factbook), so the price of food is very important to the livelihood of many Rwandans.

The map below shows the layout of Rwanda; it is split into five administrative regions. The central area around the Capital city, Kigali, is one region, and the others are North, East, South, and West.

In this quarto file, we're going to import, manipulate, visualize and forecast Rwandan potato price data. We'll also wrap our analysis into functions to make it easy to analyze prices of other foods.

```{r Packages}
if (!require(pacman)) {
  install.packages("pacman")
  library(pacman)
}

p_load(readr, dplyr, gt)
```

```{r Data Import}
potatp_prices <- read_csv("Potatoes+(Irish).csv")
```

```{r Head of Data set}
head(potatp_prices) |> 
  gt()
```
